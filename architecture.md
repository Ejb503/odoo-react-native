# Application Architecture

## Overview
This React Native application will serve as a client for an Odoo Proxy server, using voice input and the Model Context Protocol SDK (MCP) to interact with Odoo services via websocket connections.

## Architecture Layers

1. **Authentication Layer**
   - Login screen to collect username, password, and Odoo server URL
   - JWT authentication with the Odoo Proxy server
   - Secure token storage using React Native's secure storage
   - Session management

2. **Communication Layer**
   - MCP SDK integration for websocket connections
   - WebSocket connection establishment after authentication
   - Message serialization/deserialization
   - Error handling and reconnection logic

3. **Voice Processing Layer**
   - Voice input capture using React Native's audio capabilities
   - Speech-to-text conversion
   - Text processing and command extraction
   - Voice feedback (text-to-speech) for responses

4. **UI Layer**
   - Authentication screen (login form)
   - Main interface with voice input button/indicator
   - Results display area with appropriate rendering for different response types
   - Loading/processing states
   - Error displays

5. **State Management**
   - Redux or Context API for global state
   - Authentication state
   - Connection state
   - Conversation history
   - Settings/preferences
